## Drive in a Square
  1. High-level Description: The Turtlebot just needs to do three possible commands: drive forward, turn, and stop. We can lump the "stop" command in with the other two. We define two methods for the node, that will run in order of: drive, turn, drive, turn, drive, turn, drive. These methods will publish to cmd_vel with corresponding vectors.
